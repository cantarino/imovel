#### Example:  

This was a 4 week long project built during my sixth semester at Computer Engineering. The project goal was to create a web app to register houses for buy and rental.

Originally I wanted to force myself to learn new technologies, thus using node with Typescript and GraphQL. I started this process by following a fullstack project example for node + react + graphql but soon I started doing my own thing.
